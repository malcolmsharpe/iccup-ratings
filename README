How to generate a leaderboard from scratch:
  # Create the game table.
  python create_db.py

  # Populate the game table by crawling iCCup website. Takes a very long time.
  # TODO: Can't currently be run from scratch (needs a seed player).
  python populate.py

  # Using the current contents of the game table (possibly incomplete), generate the leaderboard
  # table in the database. Clears the old table, if any.
  python leaderboard.py

  # Generate a pretty HTML leaderboard at "html/leaderboard.html".
  python present.py
